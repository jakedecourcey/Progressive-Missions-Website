        <h5>Rescue</h5>
        <p>There are times when people just need to be rescued. We have the opportunity and the calling to help our brothers and sisters in their time of great need. There is a time and a place to simply give in order to rescue a struggling people.</p>
        <p>Help doesn’t end there. Rescue is a short-term solution. It can not be sustained and it does not help for long. When our efforts are limited to rescue, there will never be lasting impact. Ongoing rescue simply traps the helper and the helped in a cycle of dependency.</p>

        <p>We must transition our efforts from the hand-out to the hand-up. Rehabilitation is an investment in time and an investment in people. It requires us to stand alongside our brothers and sisters in developing countries.</p>
        <p>Long-term impact comes with the investment of time, experience, education, training, encouragement, etc. The way we approach the mission must change. If we are going to make a difference, we must be <strong>Progressive</strong></p>

        <p>As of 2014, Uganda’s population is 39 million people. Of that population, 48.2% are 0-14 years old. 12% of these children are orphans. Years of war, famine and AIDS have left a generation of Ugandans without parents.*</p>

        <h5>That’s 2.2 million orphaned children.</h5>

        <p>These are children who need to be rescued and a system that needs to be rehabilitated.</p>

        <h3>Business on Purpose</h3>
        <p>In the American culture, we identify poverty as a lack of material possessions. We seek to alleviate poverty by providing resources.

          In cultures outside our own, those who are impoverished associate poverty with a lack of hope, a lack of dignity, and a lack of self-worth.

          What if we sought to alleviate poverty by addressing these issues? Rather than provide a handout that offers temporary relief and long-term dependence, we can invest in the lives of the poorest among us to give them a sense of hope, dignity, and self-worth.

          What if we offer a hand-up instead of a hand-out?

          You can make a lasting difference. You can have impact today and for generations to come. Together, we can bring an end to a welfare mindset that keeps people impoverished, dependent, and lacking a hopeful, productive future.</p>
