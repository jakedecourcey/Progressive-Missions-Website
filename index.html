        <p>There are times when people just need to be rescued. We have the opportunity and the calling to help our brothers and sisters in their time of great need. There is a time and a place to simply give in order to rescue a struggling people.</p>
        <p>Help doesn’t end there. Rescue is a short-term solution. It can not be sustained and it does not help for long. When our efforts are limited to rescue, there will never be lasting impact. Ongoing rescue simply traps the helper and the helped in a cycle of dependency.</p>

        <h5>Rehabilitation</h5>
        <p>We must transition our efforts from the hand-out to the hand-up. Rehabilitation is an investment in time and an investment in people. It requires us to stand alongside our brothers and sisters in developing countries.</p>
        <p>Long-term impact comes with the investment of time, experience, education, training, encouragement, etc. The way we approach the mission must change. If we are going to make a difference, we must be <strong>Progressive</strong></p>

        <h3>Uganda Orphan Project</h3>
        <p>As of 2014, Uganda’s population is 39 million people. Of that population, 48.2% are 0-14 years old. 12% of these children are orphans. Years of war, famine and AIDS have left a generation of Ugandans without parents.*</p>

        <h5>That’s 2.2 million orphaned children.</h5>

        <p>These are children who need to be rescued and a system that needs to be rehabilitated.</p>

        <h3>Business on Purpose</h3>
        <p>In the American culture, we identify poverty as a lack of material possessions. We seek to alleviate poverty by providing resources.

          In cultures outside our own, those who are impoverished associate poverty with a lack of hope, a lack of dignity, and a lack of self-worth.

          What if we sought to alleviate poverty by addressing these issues? Rather than provide a handout that offers temporary relief and long-term dependence, we can invest in the lives of the poorest among us to give them a sense of hope, dignity, and self-worth.

          What if we offer a hand-up instead of a hand-out?

          You can make a lasting difference. You can have impact today and for generations to come. Together, we can bring an end to a welfare mindset that keeps people impoverished, dependent, and lacking a hopeful, productive future.</p>

              <h5>Project Support</h5>
              <p>Progressive Missions is currently partnering with Ray of Hope Orphan Centre in Kampala, Uganda. With the help of partners like you, the orphanage now operates a school for about 275 children. They receive healthy meals and a quality education.

                Your contribution to the project will cover expenses such as

                Food: All students are fed two healthy meals each day and resident students receive three meals.
                School supplies: Books, pencils, paper and other items are provided to enable students to keep up with their assignments.
                Teachers’ wages: Ray of hope currently employs 8 teachers, an administrator, and a social worker. The social worker is required by law and serves as a liaison between the school and government agencies.
                Utilities: Water and electricity were installed recently to improve the learning environment.
                Dormitory: While it is the goal of Ray of Hope to connect these children with families so they have a home to go to at night, there are children in crisis who need a place to sleep. A dormitory setting is provided to keep children safe while long-term solutions are sought.

                Please consider making a donation to the Uganda Orphan Project using the “donate” button in the left column or by mailing your contribution to the address in the left column.</p>

                <h5>Orphan Support</h5>
                <p>Ray of Hope Orphan Centre meets the needs of 275 children. Many of the basic needs of these children would not be met except for the generous contributions of partners. Your support of an orphan will assist the school in providing education, clothes, food, and hope.

                  Would you consider committing to sponsor an orphan for one year? The cost is $40 per month. We will keep you abreast of the progress in the life of your student and in the school. You will receive updates from the school and letters from your child.

                  You can also choose to sponsor a student. A student is a child who attends the school for education and receives two meals daily. They then return to their home at night. The cost to sponsor a student is $10 per month. As with the orphans, you will receive reports and letters from your child.

                  Please click here to see some of the children you can sponsor.
